# Bingo game and generator

A bingo game and sheet generator built with Next.js and React.
Features include playable bingo games, printable bingo sheets, wedding cards, and game simulations.

I made this for my wedding. It was a fun game. The design is sh*t but I only had about an hour for this,
plus it was projected in a bright room so it was hard to see the details anyway.
